Things to keep in mind when contacting your MoC:

* In-person visits carry the most weight.
* Call call call! Telephone is our most important and widely used form of contact.
* Letters are good, but take an extremely long time to arrive (due to security screening).
* Email is of little help. (Not zero, but very little.)
* Petitions are no help.

If you've never telephoned an MoC before, fear not. It's easy.
