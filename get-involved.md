Here are some things you can do to get involved with TX-10 Indivisible:

### Read the Indivisible Guide

Start with [The Indivisible
Guide](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/download-the-guide). That's
the playbook we're following. It presents a specific strategy designed
especially for us to resist the bad policies coming from Trump and
his supporters.

### Join our Facebook Group

If you're a Facebook user, join the [TX-10 Indivisible Facebook
Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tx10indivisible/) where we post our
announcements and "call to action" notices. We also share selected
links of interest. It's a closed group, and you can request access from the above-linked page.

After you join the Facebook group, be sure to click "Notifications"
in the page banner and select "All Posts". Otherwise you'll miss our
announcements. The group volume is low so you won't be flooded.

### Follow us on Twitter

If you're a Twitter user, follow [@TX10Indivisible](https://twitter.com/TX10Indivisible).

Please retweet and comment as appropriate and help amplify our social media message.

### Take Action!

to the Facebook group, on Twitter, and on our website.
