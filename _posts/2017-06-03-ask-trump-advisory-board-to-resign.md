This is a great idea from another Indivisible chapter. (And a welcome change from calling Republican MoC's)
from Jessica Craven with Indivisible North Coast Oregon:
"I’ve gathered together the contact info for the top eight companies remaining on Trump’s economic advisory board and asked them to follow Elon Musk and Bob Iger (of Disney) by stepping down in protest. It’s some of the only leverage we have, and it’s important that Trump see that NO ONE will stand with him after making this terrible decision.

Please forward this to your groups and ask them to do as many of these as they can (I also provide tweets for each company. Please tweet them if you can or re-tweet mine at @Craven7Jessica):

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
> I am deeply distressed to see your company still on Trump’s economic advisory board after his refusal to honor the Paris Agreement. Seventy-one percent of Americans wanted him to stay in it, and it was heartening to see Elon Musk and Disney step down in protest when he refused to. Why has your company not followed suit? I urge you to be a good corporate citizen and do so immediately. Thank you.
Or whatever you feel moved to say.
