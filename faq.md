### I'm not in TX-10. Is there an Indivisible group in my district?

Probably. Find an Austin-area group on the Indivisible Austin [Congressional Districts](http://www.indivisibleaustin.com/take-action-now/congressional-districts/) page. Or, search the Indivisible Team [local group directory](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/local-action-groups).


### What's the relationship between TX-10 Indivisible, Indivisible Austin, Indivisible Team, and all the little Indivisibles?

_TX-10 Indivisible_ is distinct from all these other groups, with an
objective to act in the Texas 10th Congressional District.

The Indivisible movement is a true grass-roots, decentralized movement.
Each organization plans and acts independently.

But we work closely with our peer district groups and the Austin group.
We communicate with the national group as well as other localities.

The network of independent Indivisible organizations work to pool resources
and coordinate actions.
